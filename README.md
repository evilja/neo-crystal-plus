This application is written in Rustlang.

You can compile it with "cargo build" (rust compiler)

Current keybindings:

U or KEY UP -> go up OR volume up (special interaction mode)

J or KEY_DOWN -> go down OR volume down (special interaction mode)

p -> play the selected music

s -> pause

l -> loop mode

o -> special interaction mode

TODO: 

Progress bar instead of plain "Crystal" text

Blacklist songs (prevent them from playing)

Search songs or playlist, they work similarly in my head so I'll do the one I decide to do at the moment lmao
